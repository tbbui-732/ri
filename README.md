# ri (reduced vi) 
ri is a simplified vi-like text editor designed for users who prefer a minimalist
set of commands while still enjoying the essential features of vi. If you find 
traditional vi or vim commands overwhelming, ri aims to be a more user-friendly alternative. 

Note: This project is heavily in the beginning stages.

## Current plans to implement
- Opening files for basic viewing
- Basic vim motions: Navigate with the classic hjkl movements

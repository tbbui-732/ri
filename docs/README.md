# ri (re - vi)
## Background
ri aims to rebuild vi from the ground-up using the ncurses library.
The goal of ri is to be a user friendly alternative to vi/vim/nvim,
both visually and with more common key-bindings.





TODO: Insert some challenges presented by regular vi
and how ri aims to remedy these challenges





## Ideas (to eventually implement)
- Utilize key-bindings from VS code's vim package
    - Visually selecting a block of text and hitting tab will indent it
    - Built-in feature to comment out blocks of code like (select + gc)

## Current build
- Implement cursor movement with base hjkl keys
